   cd web-scanning-tools
   

2. Install dependencies:
   Run the setup.py script to install all required Python packages and tools (e.g., Nmap and Nikto):
   bash
   sudo python3 setup.py

 Configuration

The application uses a MySQL database for storing user accounts and scan results. The database configuration is defined in config.py:
python
DATABASECONFIG = {
    'user': 'root',
    'password': 'mysqlYRARJz',
    'host': '157.173.126.210',   MySQL server IP address
    'database': 'pythonfyp',
    'port': 3306,
}


 Steps to Configure MySQL Database:
1. Set up MySQL server:
   - Install MySQL server if not already installed:
     bash
     sudo apt-get install mysql-server   For Ubuntu/Debian
     sudo yum install mysql-server       For CentOS
     
   - Start the MySQL service:
     bash
     sudo systemctl start mysql
     sudo systemctl enable mysql
     

2. Create the database:
   - Log in to MySQL:
     bash
     mysql -u root -p
     
   - Create a database:
     sql
     CREATE DATABASE pythonfyp;
     

3. Modify config.py:
   - Update the DATABASECONFIG with your MySQL server details.
